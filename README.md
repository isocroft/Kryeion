# Kryeion

A mid-sized CSS library for quick custom UI styles based on Modernizr and Bootstrap

## About

Kryeion makes it really easy to create custom widgets and simple no-tween effects by simply adding a class or set of classes to your HTML. It's really that simple. It works great
with **Modernizr** classes, **Browsengine** and of course our very beloved **Bootstrap CSS** (plans are on the way to support **Foundation CSS** as well).

## How to Use
