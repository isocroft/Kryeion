# Kryeion

A mid-sized CSS library for quick application of custom UI styles. However, it depends on the classes generated by **Modernizr** and **Browsengine** JavaScript libraries to function well. Unlike [**Bulma.io**](https://www.github.com/jgthms/bulma) or [**Bootstrap**](https://www.github.com/twbs/bootstrap), it also supports both **float-based** and **flexbox-based** layouts and widgets. It also comes in a modular structure and is geared towards _progressive enhancement_ with support for browsers like _old IE_, _old Firefox_ and _Opera Mini_. It also has **utility and helper classes** for quick but apt UI effects e.g. flipping an element 90 degrees or having a fancy header.

## About

Kryeion makes it really easy to create custom widgets and simple no-tween effects by simply adding a class or set of classes to your HTML. It's really that simple. It works great with [**Modernizr**](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) and [**Browsengine**](https://github.com/isocroft/browsengine). However, It's still in active development.
